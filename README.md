## **Title**
Employing Neural Networks for Early Detection of Ocular Diseases

## **Category**
Multi-Class Classification, Medicine

## **Names**
Ana Daley (amd2yc), Evan Mitchell (etm8fs), Cecily Wolfe (cew4pf)

## **Motivation**
As of 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates over two billion people suffer from visual impairment, and nearly half of these cases were preventable, or have not yet been treated (1). Neural networks can mitigate challenges inherent in diagnosis, using advanced classification algorithms to enable early detection and correction.

## **Dataset**
The Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset on Kaggle provided by Peking University and Shanggong Medical Technology Co. Ltd. includes 5000 color fundus images of retinal tissue taken with various camera brands, including Canon, Zeis, and Kowa. Pictures of the right and left eyes of patients are labeled with at one of eight diagnoses – normal (1140 cases), diabetes (1128), glaucoma (215), cataract (212), age-related macular degeneration (164), hypertension (103), myopia (174), and other diseases/abnormalities (979) – as well as patients’ age and sex (2,3).
